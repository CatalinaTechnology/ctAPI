ctAPI RESTful API Overview
=======
ctAPI has the ability to be accessed via RESTful API calls.  In order to use the Catalina ctAPI RESTful API web services, you will need to install a licensed copy of the web services on a server that has access to your Dynamics SL application and system databases.  An administrator will also need to configure the web services and give you an API Key and a Secret Key so that your API calls will know how to communicate with Dynamics SL and what type of resources you will have access to.
